## Tak-server

This is me playing with Iron, and an attempt to use tak-rs. Currently you play
on localhost:8080, and pass in moves in the url, separated by slashes.

A game I just played against myself was: https://tak-server.herokuapp.com/e1F2/a1F1/c3F1/c2F2/b3F1/d3F2/b2F1/b4F2/c4F1/d4F2/c5F1/c2U1/b1F1/d4L1/b5F1/c3L01/c2F1/d3L1/d2F1/e2F2/e3F1/b3D01/d3F1/e2L1/a3F1/b4D1/c2U1/c3D112/c3F1/c4D01/a2F1/a4F2/a5F1/d4S2/d5C1/a4U1/e5F1/c3U12/a4F1/b2L11/b4F1/b3U11/c3F1

I know this is a terrible idea, I just wanted to try something out. Better
ideas for communication and such incoming.
